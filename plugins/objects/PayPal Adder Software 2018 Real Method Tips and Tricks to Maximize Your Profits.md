PayPal is a popular online payment system that allows users to send and receive money securely and conveniently. PayPal has millions of customers worldwide and is widely accepted by many online merchants and platforms. However, some people claim that they have found a way to get free money from PayPal using a software called PayPal Adder.
 
PayPal Adder Software is a program that supposedly generates money and adds it to your PayPal account. The software claims to use a secret algorithm that hacks into PayPal's database and transfers funds to your account. Some websites offer this software for free, while others charge a fee or require you to complete surveys or tasks. Some even claim that this software is a real method that works in 2018.

However, there is no evidence that PayPal Adder Software is legitimate or safe. In fact, it is most likely a scam that aims to steal your personal information, infect your device with malware, or trick you into paying for a fake product. PayPal itself warns its users to beware of such scams and phishing attempts. PayPal states that it never asks for your password, security questions, verification codes, PINs, or any other personal information by email, phone, or text message. PayPal also advises its users to report any suspicious activity or emails to spoof@paypal.com.
 
Therefore, it is best to avoid PayPal Adder Software and any similar programs that promise free money from PayPal. They are not real methods, but scams that can harm you and your account. Instead, you should use PayPal's official website or app to manage your money and transactions safely and securely.

How do PayPal Adder Software scams work? There are different variations of this scam, but they all have the same goal: to trick you into giving up your personal or financial information, or to make you pay for a worthless product. Here are some common ways that scammers try to lure you into their trap:
 
- They offer you a free download of the software, but ask you to complete a survey or a task first. The survey or task may ask you for your personal details, such as your name, email, phone number, address, etc. The scammers may then use this information to spam you, sell it to other parties, or even steal your identity.
- They ask you to pay a fee to access the software or to activate it. The fee may be a one-time payment or a recurring subscription. The scammers may ask you to pay using an untraceable method, such as a gift card, a wire transfer, or a cryptocurrency. Once you pay, you may not receive the software at all, or you may receive a fake or malicious program that does not work.
- They send you an email or a message that looks like it comes from PayPal, but it is actually a phishing attempt. The email or message may claim that there is a problem with your account, that you have received a payment, or that you need to verify your identity. The email or message may contain a link that directs you to a fake website that looks like PayPal's official site. The fake website may ask you to enter your login credentials, your credit card information, or other sensitive data. The scammers may then use this information to access your account and steal your money.

How can you protect yourself from PayPal Adder Software scams? The best way to avoid falling victim to these scams is to use common sense and caution. Here are some tips that can help you stay safe online:

- Do not trust any offer that sounds too good to be true. There is no such thing as free money from PayPal. If someone claims that they can give you money for nothing, they are probably lying.
- Do not download any software from unknown or untrusted sources. Only download software from reputable and verified websites or platforms. Always scan any file that you download with an antivirus program before opening it.
- Do not click on any links or attachments in unsolicited emails or messages. Always check the sender's address and the URL of the website before entering any information. If you are not sure if an email or message is from PayPal, contact PayPal's customer service directly.
- Do not share your personal or financial information with anyone online. Never give out your password, security questions, verification codes, PINs, or any other confidential data to anyone who asks for it by email, phone, or text message. PayPal will never ask you for such information in this way.
- Report any suspicious activity or emails to PayPal. If you encounter any scam attempt involving PayPal Adder Software or any other program, report it to PayPal's security center at https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/report-problem. You can also forward any phishing emails to spoof@paypal.com.
