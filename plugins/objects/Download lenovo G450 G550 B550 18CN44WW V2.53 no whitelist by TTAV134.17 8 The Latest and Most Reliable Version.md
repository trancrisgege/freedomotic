If you have a Lenovo G450, G550 or B550 laptop and you want to upgrade your wireless card or install a different operating system, you may encounter a problem with the BIOS whitelist. The BIOS whitelist is a feature that prevents the laptop from booting with unauthorized hardware or software. This can limit your options and cause compatibility issues.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to bypass the BIOS whitelist and install any wireless card or operating system you want. You can do this by downloading and installing a modified BIOS version that has no whitelist. This version is called Lenovo G450 G550 B550 18CN44WW V2.53 No Whitelist BIOS by TTAV134, and it was created by a user named TTAV134 on bios-mods.com.

## Step 2: Extract the BIOS file
 
The next step is to extract the BIOS file to a folder on your desktop. You can use any program that can unzip files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. After extracting, you should see a folder named "LenovoG450G550" with several files inside.
 
## Step 3: Backup your original BIOS
 
Before flashing the modified BIOS, it is highly recommended that you backup your original BIOS in case something goes wrong or you want to revert back later. To do this, you need to run the "backup.bat" file inside the "LenovoG450G550" folder. This will create a backup file named "backup.bin" in the same folder.
 
## Step 4: Flash the modified BIOS
 
Now you are ready to flash the modified BIOS on your laptop. To do this, you need to run the "flash.bat" file inside the "LenovoG450G550" folder. This will launch a command prompt window that will guide you through the flashing process. Follow the instructions carefully and do not interrupt the process until it is finished.
 
## Step 5: Restart your laptop
 
After flashing the modified BIOS, you need to restart your laptop for the changes to take effect. You can do this by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del or holding down the power button for a few seconds. When your laptop boots up, you should see the new BIOS version 18CN44WW V2.53 on the startup screen.
